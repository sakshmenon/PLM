Saksh, below are a few approaches to compute significance of the found similarity. Start implementing them. I will generate embeddings between 2 annotated organisms baker's yeast vs fission yeast, where the proteins are known and annotated. We will be able to check the significance metrics based on them. 
    


Possible:

Ensemble Similarity Computation: 
Use an ensemble of slightly different similarity measures (e.g., cosine, Pearson correlation, 
Euclidean distance) and check if the top hits remain consistent across these measures.

Similarity Score Distribution: 
Analyze the distribution of cosine similarity scores across all reference vectors. 
If the distribution of the scores is highly concentrated (e.g., most similarities are close to zero), 
then outliers (very high similarity scores) may be more significant.

Distribution-Based Index: 
Fit the similarity values to a known probability distribution (e.g., Gaussian, exponential). 
If the similarity of a top hit lies in the tail of this distribution, it is likely significant.



Vector Approaches:

Vector Magnitude Analysis: 
Compute the magnitude (L2 norm) of both the input vector and the top hit vectors. 
Large magnitudes, combined with high cosine similarity, may indicate that the match is more significant, as it is less likely 
to result from chance (since the similarity between larger vectors is often more meaningful).

Entropy-Based Measures
Similarity Entropy: 
Compute the entropy of the cosine similarity scores for the top-N hits. Lower entropy suggests that the 
similarity values are more deterministic and significant.

Statistical Significance Testing: 
Use statistical tests, such as permutation tests, to assess whether the similarity score of a top hit is significantly 
different from what would be expected by random chance.

Bootstrapping: 
Randomly sample reference vectors and recompute the cosine similarity to estimate a confidence interval for the similarity scores.
Hits that consistently have high similarity across bootstrapped samples can be considered more reliable.

Stability Across Projections: 
Compute the cosine similarity using different feature subsets or random projections to see if the 
ranking of top hits remains stable. Stable hits across different projections are more likely to be reliable.
